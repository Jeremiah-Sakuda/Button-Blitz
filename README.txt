2. **Install Extensions**:
   - To enhance the development experience, install the following VS Code extensions:
     - **Live Server** (for real-time preview of the HTML file).
     - **Prettier - Code Formatter** (for consistent code formatting).
     - **ESLint** (to ensure JavaScript code quality).

3. **Open the Project in VS Code**:
